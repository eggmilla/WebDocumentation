			<h2>Iterative Process</h2>
        <p>
          I took inspiration from government sites such as <a href="https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/">my aged care</a> and <a href="https://www.ombudsman.vic.gov.au/complaints/make-complaint/">Victoria's ombudsman</a> as they are rated as highly accessible. Drawing upon their similarities, I discoverd that they:
          <ul> 
            <li>use colour blocking</li>
            <li>have lots of white space</li>
            <li>use only one typeface with different weights and sizes</li>
            <li>have links or buttons to reveal more information</li>
          </ul> 
          I wanted to take these into account when creating my own website in order to be more inclusive. The initial changes I made were: 
          <ul>
            <li>using two typefaces</li>
            <li>not using a cow print pattern background as it could be very distracting even if static</li>
            <li>creating obvious hover states for all links - used underline and colour change for text</li>
            <li>creating more white space</li>
          </ul>
        </p> 
        <p> From retail sites such as <a href="https://www.zeroco.com.au">zero co</a> and <a href="https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html?aid=30259&source=9784485770-99392563126-432134308539-kwd-299051556947">ad guard</a> I saw the use of animation and call-to-actions and was inspired to possibly include some of these on my site. I included a 'donate now' button on the landing page as the header doesn't feature an explicit link to the donation page. I couldn't find a way to include animations in my final assignment but I think they could be a space for further development. 
        </p>
        <h3>Initial Design</h3> 
        <img class="screenshot" src="/all/1_page.png">
        <img class="screenshot"  src="/all/1_page2.jpg">
        <p><em>Two different typefaces for main text and navigation, title and footer text.</em></p>
        <img class="screenshot"  src="/all/1_page3.png">
        <p><em>4 square images as shortcut links</em></p>

        <p> Additionally, when performing casual user feedback I was told: 
        </p>
        <img src="/feedback.png">
        <img src="/feedback2.png">
        <p>Points #4 and #5 are referring to the footer as the social media favicons were spaced across the entire bottom of the footer.</p>
        <p>
        And in combination with this feedback and reflecting on my site's main purpose, I made further changes:
        <ul>
          <li>having a slightly see-through hero textbox</li>
          <li>used only one typeface to keep content looking consistent</li>
          <li>using round borders on images to create more white space</li>
          <li>pushing all the social media links in the footer to one side for convenience and better spacing</li>
          <li>creating a thinner footer to not "squash" the page when both header and footer are visible</li>
          <li>dimming images to brighten them when hovered over for obvious image hover states</li>
          <li>having a consistent look for all images (which are also links) - round, dimmed and with caption underneath</li> 
          <li>omitted the "learn more" shortcut image from the landing page as it wouldn't be considered on the main purposes of the site and it is featured in the header</li> 
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Second Design</h3> 
        <img class="screenshot" src="/all/2_page.png">
        <img class="screenshot"  src="/all/2_page2.png">
        <p><em>One typeface across whole site</em></p>
        <img class="screenshot"  src="/all/2_page3.png">
        <p><em>3 images with round borders for white space + lower brightness for more obvious hover states</em></p>


        <h3>Third Design</h3> 
        <img class="screenshot" src="/all/4_page.png">
        <img class="screenshot" src="/all/4_page1.png">
        <p><em>Changed the colour scheme of the website as I received a lot of feedback on the lack of colour on content pages.</em></p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="/all/4_page2.png">
        <p><em>Put a gradient background behind the donation form to draw more attention to it.</em></p>
        <img class="screenshot"  src="/all/5_page.png">
        <p><em>Added in breadcrumb navigation (forgot to code it in earlier) and it also added a nice extra pop of colour on the page!</em></p>

        <h3>Site Map</h3> 
        <p>I had some links from the website lead to an 'intentionally blank page' in place of actual content/external sites. This site map with comments on it shows justifications and what is meant to be in place of the blank page.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p> 
        There were a few things that I wish I could have applied to my website which I couldn't figure out how to do or required javascript code which I wasn't able to figure out how to use. For example, having the navgiation menu tuck away into a â‰¡ icon for mobile devices, including some animations for the landing page and having a scroll to the top/bottom buttons. I enjoyed creating a resizable website albeit all its challenges. However, through this assignment I think I have learnt the magic of HTML and CSS and have a greater appreciation for smoothly operating and aesthetic websites.
