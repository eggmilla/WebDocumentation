			<h2>Iterative Process</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Til The Cows Come Home</em> (TTCCH) is a charity that aims to give unconventional animals a second home as pets. They are essentially an adoption agency for animals from chickens to cows that farmers no longer can care for or no longer need.

        As design should always be an iterative process (Nielson, J. 1993), ideation for the website was started by creating mood boards, doing quick sketches and planning a site map.
