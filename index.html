			<h2>Background Research</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Til The Cows Come Home</em> (TTCCH) is a charity that aims to give unconventional animals a second home as pets. They are essentially an adoption agency for animals from chickens to cows that farmers no longer can care for or no longer need.

			<h3 id="userresearch">User Research</h3>
      <p> 
        According to the financial overview on the <a href="#https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/e1535b82efd6f4e9afd92c95e7f3014a">acnc.gov site</a>, TTCCH only generated <em>$60 from donations</em> from a total of $1178 but had $18,200 in expenses. Despite the valuable work that the organisation is doing, there seems to be a lack of funding from donations which could be boosted with more coverage on the importance of a foundation like TTCCH. 
      </p> 
      The purpose of the site would be: 
      <ul>
        <li> 
          to raise awareness and thus generate more donations 
        </li>  
        <li> 
          to create a platform for donors and fosterers to contact TTCCH for respective needs 
        </li>
      </ul>
			<p> 
        As TTCCH is an online based organisation, there needs to be great focus on accesbile and inclusive design. Further, a large proportion of users would be those already living with animals or those living on big blocks of land - most likely Australians living outside of main cities. This flows onto the larger idea of a ‘digital divide’ in Australia, as according the Australian Bureau of Statistics, over 1.3 million households are not connected to the internet and almost 2.6 million Australians do not use the internet (Thomas, J et al. 2018). With this context in mind it was vital to research into designing a website that would accommodate to those who are not fluent with technology. 
      </p> 
      Points taken away from <em>User Research</em> were that:
      <ul>
        <li> 
          creating a site that is forgiving for errors 
        </li>
        <li> 
          using large targets 
        </li>
        <li> 
          checking viewability of colours and contrast
        </li> 
        <li> 
          using semantic html for page readers 
        </li> 
      </ul>
      (Kane, L. 2019) 
      <br>
      <h3 id="ethn">Online Ethnography</h3>
			<p>
        Online ethnography is the process of “gathering insights from online communities” (Tomitsch et al., 2018, p. 94). As it was difficult to personally get in touch with those living in rural communities, a thematic analysis was made of opinions found online. Main searches were on adoption processes in NSW or Australia and most posts were found on reddit due to the nature of the community forum site. 
      </p>
      
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <th>Theme</th>

      <p>
        As raising a pet is a big commitment, many people asked about reputable shelters, pounds, stores or organisations to adopt from. Almost all forums suggested rescues over pet stores and there were consistent suggestions such as <a href="https://catprotection.org.au/">The Cat Protection Society of NSW</a> and <a href="https://www.rspcansw.org.au/adopt/">The RSPCA</a>. However, it seems that most people tend to visit multiple locations before deciding on an animal to take in. Also, few users did not appreciate the lack of response from organisations. 
      </p>
      Points taken away from <em>Online Ethnography</em> were that: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          building credibility is crucial
        </li>
        <li>
          emphasis on ‘rescue’ appeals to those who are looking to adopt
        </li>
        <li> 
          providing timely responses to emails and calls and/or listing an estimated callback period to put users at ease 
        </li>
      </ul>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>
        According to Tomitsch et al. (2018), user profiles are a succinct way to present key attributes of discovered potential users. The template of age range, motivation, needs and examples of when they would interact with the product was used.

      Points taken away from <em>User Profiles</em> were that: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          making other forms of communication obvious and pronounced would allow for a larger wide of audiences to interact with TTCCH

        </li>
        <li>
          excluding pop ups would be helpful and less distracting 
        </li>
        <li>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p> 
        As design should always be an iterative process (Nielson, J. 1993), ideation for the website was started by creating mood boards, doing quick sketches and planning a site map. 
      </p>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>
        Moodboards aid in organising inspiration and help to refine a projects' visual style early on (Chapman, u.d.) Two different boards which had different atmospheres and potentials were created.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/retro.png" alt="retro and green moodboard"/>
        <figcaption>Retro design that makes use of banners and simple shapes.</figcaption>

        <img src="/sleek.png" alt="sleek and simple moodboard"/>
        <figcaption>Sleek design that makes use of point colour and typeface contrast.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In order to create a more open and 'friendly' brand identity, the <em>retro and green</em> was selected as the final inspiration. 
      </p>
      <h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p> 
        To get ideas about how the site would look and work, multiple sketches were drawn up. Like outlined by Tomitsch et al. (2018), sketches were quick and aided in making ideas more clear and 'real'. Below are some sketches digitally drawn. 
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/sketchPlain.png" alt="sketch of a simple and practical webpage"/>

        <figcaption>Practical layout with added 'personality'.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3 id="sitemap">Site Map</h3>
			<p> 
        As the sketches and later, wireframes, of the site developed, the organisation of the website changed which meant that the site map was also being updated. 
        <figure>
          <img src="/sitemap2.png" alt="first site map for proposed website"/>

          <figcaption>Final Site Map.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>

		</section>
		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>
        From ideation of mutliple ideas and concepts, a final wireframe was created. Initially it was based off of one sketch but with user feedback, different features were added and replaced to create a more harmonious and accesible design. As it was difficult to get into contact with exact user audiences, context was given to peers and family and they were asked to use the site as if they were like some of the User Profiles. 
      </p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>
        The wireframe design was edited quite a few times with casual user feedback mainly from University students. The visual design of cow prints was not included in the first two wireframes as it seemed more important to decide on the layout of the site. 
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>
        Mock ups are an essential component of website and application design as they most highly resemble the desired completed look and feel of products. 
      </p>
      <h4>Desktop Mockup</h4>
      <p>
        The landing page was kept as empty as possible as use of whitespace and images sends a more coherent message and keeps user's attention (Lindgaard, 2004). This was also applied to other pages of the website design, but sometimes was unavoidable due to the nature the information being presented. 
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/searchBar.png" alt="image of search bar design revision"/>
        <figcaption>Through mockups, small design details were changed and developed such as the search bar.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Similarly, the colour scheme of the website was changed to match the organisation's logo rather than the green and cream scheme decided in the moodboard. As many images were used across the website, using the one colour from the logo seemed more appropriate than introducing two other colours.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest learning from completing this was that building websites for a wide range of audiences is challenging and sometimes requires design compromises. However, as it was my goal to keep the website as simple and easy to use as possible, I think the overall design is not majorly lacking. It would have been beneficial to get less interent-fluent users to test the wireframes and mock-ups of the site and I think for the final assignment I will get in touch with extended family to trial my website. Although my mockups don't display some design elements, in my final project I wish to implement distinct hover statuses over any clickable object and possibly have the up & down arrows work to actually scroll the webpage.
